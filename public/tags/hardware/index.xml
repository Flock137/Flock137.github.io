      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to start my hardware hacking journey with an attempt to live debugging a piece of hardware. As I am waiting for the necessary parts I need to arrive, I did some emulations of the STM32, so I might have the binary ready to flash the binary into the hardware by the times the parts arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As weird as it is to write about a failed attempt on a blog post, this is written to at least temporary record what I did, for potential future references. The code for this attempt would not be released, as I definitely do not want to embarrase myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
