For this tutorial, I would use the theme PaperMod - a very clean, elegant and minimalistic Hugo theme, just the way that I like. And, of course, deploy it on github, because it's relatively simple and it's free.

Note: Probably for GitHub pages, you may prefer Jekyll as your framework, instead of Hugo. While I did have that in mind, I still choose Hugo because it's "prettier" out-of-the-box for my taste.
